# Color of <strike>Berlin</strike> Montréal

A Twitter bot that tweets the color of the sky in Berlin that was forked to tweet the color of the sky in Montréal.

This bot fetches the latest image of the sky in Montréal, crops and places it on an HTML5 Canvas, picks the color and matches it against a color list, fills a new Canvas with the color that was matched, then tweets the color name, image, and HEX value.
